## Project 1: Software Analysis and Design for Trading Cryptocurrency (Final Year Project, IIT Roorkee)
To Download the complete report: [Project_Report.pdf](./B_Tech_Project_Final_Report.pdf)

```markdown
• Identify effective cryptocurrency trading strategies by analyzing traditional (e.g., SMAC, EMAC, RSI, MACD, Buy-and-Hold) and custom strategies using machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, KNN, Neural Networks).  
• Evaluate strategies using metrics like Sharpe Ratio and Profit Per Day, leveraging visualizations to compare and identify top-performing approaches.  
• Tools: BeautifulSoup (web scraping), Fastquant (backtesting), Sklearn & PyTorch (machine learning), Matplotlib (visualization).

```markdown
• Variant of Advanced Decision Tree from scratch.
• Each node could be any Machine Learning model like 
Neural Network, SVM, or basic decision
tree node.
• It can have a non-linear decision boundary, unlike a standard 
decision tree, which only has a parallel feature boundary.
• Made a customizable graph that can show different features 
of each node such as impurity, class distribution, etc.
• Whole Tree structure can viewed in graphical format.
• Tools: Python (SK learn) and graphviz.

```markdown
• Ported MXNet Code into Pytorch for the book Dive Into Deep Learning by Aston
Jhang et al.
• Converted the book to an interactive Jupyter Notebook format.
• Contributed and maintained d2l-pytorch on GitHub (3000+ stars and 900+
forks).
• Tools: Python(Pytorch).

## Project 4: [Number plate Detection](https://github.com/dsgiitr/np_detection), Data Science Group, IIT Roorkee
To verify this certificate visit: [https://ecertificate.iitr.ac.in/verification/2c5c8c95-0dd6-4ab2-bed7-8e74ded1812d](https://ecertificate.iitr.ac.in/verification/2c5c8c95-0dd6-4ab2-bed7-8e74ded1812d)

```markdown
• Detect vehicles and record their number plates from CCTV cameras for security
purposes.
• The system tracks the vehicle and then separates the number plate from the vehicle
(openCV) and outputs the digits (OCR).
• Tools: Pytorch, openCV and YOLO.
