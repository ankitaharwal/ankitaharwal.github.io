# PROJECTS

## Project 1: Software Analysis and Design for Trading Cryptocurrency (Final Year Project, IIT Roorkee)
To Download the complete PDF: [Project Report](./B_Tech_Project_Final_Report.pdf)

<!-- ```markdown -->
- Goal: Identify profitable cryptocurrency trading strategies.  
- Methods: Traditional (e.g., SMAC, EMAC, RSI, MACD, Buy-and-Hold) and machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, KNN, Neural Networks).  
- Evaluation: Profit-per-day metric with visual comparisons.  
- Conclusion: SMAC(5,15) and Buy-and-Hold yield the highest median of 4.2 profit-per-day.  
- Tools: BeautifulSoup (scraping), Fastquant (backtesting), Sklearn & PyTorch (ML), Matplotlib (visualization).

## Project 2: [Decision Tree Steroid](https://github.com/ankitaharwal/Decision_Tree-Steroid) (Data Science Group, IIT Roorkee)

<!-- ```markdown -->
- Variant of Advanced Decision Tree from scratch.
- Each node could be any Machine Learning model like 
Neural Network, SVM, or basic decision
tree node.
- It can have a non-linear decision boundary, unlike a standard 
decision tree, which only has a parallel feature boundary.
- Made a customizable graph that can show different features 
of each node such as impurity, class distribution, etc.
- Whole Tree structure can viewed in graphical format.
- Tools: Python (SK learn) and graphviz.

## Project 3: [D2l-PyTorch](https://github.com/dsgiitr/d2l-pytorch), Data Science Group, IIT Roorkee
To verify this certificate visit: [Link](https://ecertificate.iitr.ac.in/verification/419fffae-e64d-46bc-930e-8b2e8f0e1df2)

<!-- ```markdown -->
- Ported MXNet Code into Pytorch for the book Dive Into Deep Learning by Aston
Jhang et al.
- Converted the book to an interactive Jupyter Notebook format.
- Contributed and maintained d2l-pytorch on GitHub (3000+ stars and 900+
forks).
- Tools: Python(Pytorch).

## Project 4: [Number plate Detection](https://github.com/dsgiitr/np_detection), Data Science Group, IIT Roorkee
To verify this certificate visit: [Link](https://ecertificate.iitr.ac.in/verification/2c5c8c95-0dd6-4ab2-bed7-8e74ded1812d)

<!-- ```markdown -->
- Detect vehicles and record their number plates from CCTV cameras for security
purposes.
- The system tracks the vehicle and then separates the number plate from the vehicle
(openCV) and outputs the digits (OCR).
- Tools: Pytorch, openCV and YOLO.
