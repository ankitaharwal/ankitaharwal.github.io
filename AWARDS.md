Problem Statement: Highlighting and communicating COVID-19 information that is scientifically accurate

- One of the key challenges of the pandemic has been misinformation and disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.  This has led to a variety of problems, including stigma from the disease, failing to take appropriate measures, and getting the right treatment. 
- How do we enable seamless flow of trustworthy news and scientific facts to the broader population? 
- How do we equip citizens with the right information to combat the constant, viral stream of distrustful information from social media and other sources? 
- How can we encourage people to take appropriate preventative measures, to seek proper treatment and avoid excessive or incorrect use of unapproved medicines and treatment? 
- What can we do to combat the stigma of COVID-19 that is created due to unbalanced and sensationalized news?
